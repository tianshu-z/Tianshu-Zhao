<h2>Reading Response: Performativity From Schechner, R., Performance Studies: An Introduction</h2>
	   
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Throughout Ian Condry’s 2006 book, Hip-Hop Japan, one of the most discussed and perhaps most important points he is trying to make is the globalization and localization of hip-hop as a cultural phenomenon. While globalization is closely related to the transnational social and economic environments, localization requires identifying or distancing at different scales, personal or national, both from the perspective of the musicians and their fans. In this chapter specifically, Condry looks at connecting these two things, i.e. large-scale consumer culture and relatively small-scale rap fan groups, in different categories at different scopes together and analyzing the mutual influences they have on each other.
<br>
	   
The major reason Condry provides regarding choosing fan, specifically otaku, in order to understand the restructuring the consumer culture is that otaku, as ideal consumers, serves as the intermediate conduit between the systematic power of consumerism and the individual force of the consumers. The former “shapes capitalism (pp. 113)”; but because of the existence of consumers whose aim is not to consume more but to consume differently and creatively, consumerism becomes a way to frame national, local and personal identities while extending its ever-growing reach. In other words, with the advent of an increasing massification of cultural goods in the 1990s Japan, there is a compatible increase in the “diversification of niche market.” It is also worth noting that Ian Condry borrows Daniel Miller’s theory to explain the cause of the urge to consume creatively, which does not lie in a conscious choice, but “rather a desire to overcome a potential state of rupture.” Condry seems to want to highlight the powerlessness of consumers facing an excessive number of commercial goods and peer pressure by adopting Miller’s theory, and this might well be one of the reasons that contribute to the diversification of consumption. But I would argue, based upon Condry’s argument in the chapter, the fans are comparatively active and are indeed making conscious choices based upon their abundant knowledge of certain area, even though they may be still under multiple kinds of pressures.
After laying out the basic assumptions, Condry examines the large-scale consumer structure and individual consumption choice in three main aspects: one, fandom in Japan and especially otaku is described and mainly characterized as “unbalanced specialists” due to their excessive knowledge and passion in one very specific area (pp.132). Two, consumer culture is compartmentalized by otaku, which is largely a result of information overflow. Three, what otaku represents at a societal level is the disconnected islands as social organizations, which are the main driving force of restructuring “the meaning of consumption”. The rest of the chapter keeps revolving around these three main arguments.
<br>

What I appreciate the most is the overall analytical structure of this chapter. Ian Condry starts from an “ethnographic sketches” of two similar genbas, Thumpin’ Camp and Big L.B. Festival, which respectively exemplifies the underground rap scene and the party rap scene at the time when more and more hip-hop million sellers emerges. It pin-points the time, the location, the main conflict, and the fans attributes in the Japanese hip-hop scene, and moreover raises the potential questions, for instance, which side of the fans are the real fans and how they influence the consumer habits. Condry follows with a chronological analysis of postwar fandom and music genre and talks more in detail about the internal as well as external correlations of information overflow, consuming habits, and consumerism restructuring. To end the chapter, Condry revisits the two concerts he utilizes in the beginning of the chapter and assesses their legitimacy as to whether the fandom can be regarded as authentic, based on the standards and criteria he previosly talks about in the chapter.
<br>

Both in the beginning and the end, the author gives direct definitions of fandom and otaku but in different aspects. On one hand, fandom entails instabilities on their abundant knowledge and passion about certain area, their identification and skeptical distancing, and the “vague but ubiquitous” information overload (p.114). On the other hand, fans need to prove their ability of engaging, expressing, and producing through creative consumption, which should be based on their better-than-average understanding of the particular culture (p.130). Meanwhile, within the realm of fan, otaku is designated as reclusive consumers living in closed-off and media-generated worlds, which generates another intriguing phenomenon – disconnected islands. The isolated islands in space, I believe, is the key to a music industry as well as consumption habit shift, according to my interpretation of Condry’s arguments. First of all, there is an apparent disjunction between the musicians and the fans, which the author evidences in the chapter by discussing the dichotomy of underground and party hip-hop from the perspectives of both sides (pp.113). This partially indicates the distancing and intimacy instability of fandom, and supports the notion that fans are self-organized. In other words, they have their opinions on the important issues in the music scenes, and they have the right to vote on the decisions because they themselves are an essential and inseparable part of the music scenes. Second of all, the reclusive quality of islands leaves the compartmentalization and consumption of music genres opaque to the outsiders and without any ostensible distinction between superiority or inferiority. It makes us rethink “brand names frantics” in nowadays capitalist society, in the sense of otakunization, those “high-end products” are only the pursuit of one group of islanders among many. This is what I would call the driving force of a new structure of consumerism.
<br>

Criticisms of otaku or fandom are mainly focused on their excessive attention towards superficiality, for example the m consumption of the cultural goods and being overly fashion-focused. With the expansion of the cultural products pool and the abundance of cultural goods, otaku has been greatly developed and has become more and more prevalent. On one hand, it is a result of securing a personal identity partially by fanning differently and consuming differently. On the other, according to Ian, probably a more important reason is to have things to talk about with your friends, which comes out of a sense of peer pressure. However, through the whole chapter, the author falls short when it comes to a more vivid description of otaku and otaku’s life, while they are arguably the most important force in restructuring consumption environment in modern Japanese entertainment industries. It’s important to depict otaku, because one, it can lend the term an indirect but intuitive explanation; two, it provides a way for the reader to be identified with or to distance from this group of people.

<h2>Reading Response: Performativity From Schechner, R., Performance Studies: An Introduction</h2>
	   
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Due to its widespread usage in various fields, performativity allows a wide range of meanings, which makes it difficult to acquire a specific definition. Therefore, the author introduces some essential terms and incidences in both the theories and practices of performativity as a substitute of direct definition. In this chapter, firstly, we are able to grasp the history of performativity by looking at J. L. Austin’s performative utterance and J. R. Searle’s speech acts; then, the author closely examines reality TV and simulation, and how they play into the development of performativity; additionally, postmodernism and poststructuralism are explained in detail, as to their definition and how they serve as the practical and theoretical foundations of performativity; lastly, the construction of gender and race is highlighted as the examples of identity construction theory, which is the primary social function of performativity from the author’s point of view. In short, performativity emphasizes that every social activity is a showing of doing, with actors and spectators both being actively involved.
<br>
	   
In 1955, J. L. Austin, a linguistic philosopher first coined the term “performative”, and used it to describe the nature of utterances as “performing of action”. His student J. R. Searle developed his inventive conception and proposed “speech act” as the basic unit of communication in the 1960s. Whereas their contributions to the establishment of this new field are acknowledged in this chapter, they both failed building any connection between theatrical or fictional reality and real-life reality. The author uses Maya-lila notion of reality and a theatrical romance example to refute Austin’s opinion that “performative utterances in theatre are all under false circumstances”; additionally, the author also seeks scholarly support from Derrida, who argues that language in theatre is only a modification of daily speaking, and truthfulness exists in theatre within their space and time. To further draw forth the liminal space between the performativity of theatrical performance and real-life, artistic practices that explore the interplay of fiction and reality during or even before 1960s are taken as examples to pin down the limitation of Searle’s theory. The evidence from both practical and theoretic aspects well serves the arguments in these sections. However, I would suggest these two terms be put together in one section in the book, since they are closely related and share similar weaknesses.
<br>
	   
Following the discussion of fabricated reality and real reality, the author takes on further building connections in the age of digital media. Reality TV starting from the turn of the century is probably the most groundbreaking invention, in which fiction and reality are mingled and blended. After Survivor, the first reality show in the US, large capitals were put into this type of entertainment, and webcam also entered the game. As the author argues, they exploited general public’s desire to want to be part of something and their voyeurism. Gradually, average people became more and more active in broadcasting their lives too, on their own, for example Jennicam, which effectively proves people’s willingness to act in front of the others, and that the others’ observation indeed impacts the actor’s behavioral outcome. Using the example of an ordinary individual makes the author’s viewpoint particularly relatable, and also prepares for the following conversation on postmodernism and its anti-authorism. Another practice is simulation, also accompanied by digital technology development. Two layers of simulation are mentioned. One is a complete replication where original and copy defies distinction, two is what can be regarded as indistinguishable to the original one in a chronological sense. Two stories are mentioned, Baudrillard’s sickness and Shaman practice, as examples for the latter. What adds to the confusion is the most effective and influential types of simulation, i.e. military war games, and scientific experiments. It seems to be self-contradictory, because apparently, one can easily distinguish between these kinds of simulations from the reality. The author might want to add that, in these scenarios, simulations are used as a device to approach the real matter when keeping the cost reasonable.
<br>
	  
Simulation blurs authorship. Postmodernism (practice) and poststructuralism / deconstruction (theory) defies authorism in the same way. And they are the foundation of the practice and theory of performativity, which is centered on power struggle. In terms of practice, power struggle, the subversive quality and tolerance of contradictions are put forward among the characteristics of postmodernism, which is derived from the theoretic analysis by Jean-Francois Lyotard, Linda Hutcheon and Fredric Jameson. In terms of theory, the author put much emphasis on text and that writings are constant struggles for authorship and power, which is mostly based upon Jacques Derrida’s article in 1988. I personally find the deduction problematic, for the author states in the beginning that performativity is not easy to pin down due to its wide usage, but here he uses only poststructuralism in writing to prove perhaps the most important points in the whole chapter. Also, the reference seems to be outdated, as performativity is really a product taking off around 2000. The author also raises awareness that destruction of master narrative brings compression and fragmentation, and asks what if the big institutions use performative devices to gain control over knowledge. These are wonderful concerns. However, the author falls short on giving any effective comments afterwards. Also, as pointed out in the book, the problem with poststructuralism is its small-scale influence and it mostly is constrained in ivory tower.

<h2>能做到很多，为什么连完整讲一个故事都显吃力</h2>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;我从没有看过天下霸唱的《鬼吹灯》系列小说或者电影改编，但在2017年7月27日晚上看了颜永祺 (中戏导演系博士毕业) 导演的话剧《摸金玦》之后，我着实花了一段时间去困惑——为什么《鬼吹灯》会红。再明白点说，这次故事没讲好，让我怀疑这个故事本身到底是不是好故事。(没讲好的故事是不是好故事？)
<br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;在前两天刚刚看了不到一半《爱的小确幸》就夺路而逃的境况下，我其实对《摸金玦》期待不低。鄙人有看戏之前先看剧评的习惯，剧评中说，“…舞美主体，是两个看起来普通平常的墙体…让多个时空以毫无违和感的方式，让观众尽收眼底…借助裸眼3D以及先进的多媒体技术…构建出100多道场景。”[1]看到这里，更加兴趣昂然，打定决心抱着满满诚意去学习。
<br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;首先，我热爱开场对于清末爷爷辈的面具演绎。其余的，演员导演设计团队看起来应该是很努力的。
<br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;未开场先见舞台，吸引我注意力的并非那两片呈角度的直立的墙体，而是斜坡式舞台 (raked theatre)；这种复古的装置让人一下对这部戏竖直方向空间的利用有了期待。这部戏最大的亮点 (希望不是唯一的亮点) 是一开场“风雪夜归人”的场景，有感风雪之寒、社会之寒、有见幽默、凄苦。导演的指导显然用心非常，虽因演员戴着巨大的面具而不见其真颜，但各人说话都甚为清楚明了可见可感，反而让面具的效果发挥到极致。至此，舞美多媒体能做到什么，基本已胸中有数；也正如所料，在之后的将近两小时当中，没有太多让人惊喜的事情发生——最多无非是炫技多了很多，但从营造气氛震撼情感上来讲，都比不过开场5分钟。
<br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;显然这部戏的重心被放在了多媒体和舞台之上，所以权且先假设灯光和声音都努力过，空有想法，实现不足。设计师们完成了自己的任务，能够拿到60%的分数。但两个问题实在不吐不快：其一，如果追光用不好可不可以忍痛割弃？结尾廉价的流行歌曲又是哪一回事？
<br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;话说得重了点，但似乎还是远不及制作团队的ego大。于是故事被肢解了，一台戏变成了一个联欢晚会。不是不可做，而是无趣。
<br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;结篇之前，想说说现在的剧场中一些我不能理解的事，比如开场时观众拿着爆米花进来，比如听说演员演一场能拿1000-1500块。我很惊讶，这样的表演也能拿到工资？这也是很让人惊讶的事情。台上演员说了句“我生着气呢”，我左手边的观众偷偷笑着嘀咕“我生殖器呢”。这当然是做玩笑话来讲。但不开玩笑的是，我不明白为什么有些演员一会儿说半吊子东北话，一会儿说普通话；再不必说，编剧将女人都写成了感性的蠢货了。
<br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;总的来说，看这出戏还是很开心的，觉得自己应当再买袋儿瓜子儿，咱们边聊边看。制作组也非常贴心，节目单《摸金玦》中的“玦”字生怕人看不清，用了一个截然不同的字体来突出。

<h2>屠蘇酒，新桃符</h2>
<br>
爆竹聲中一歲除，春風送暖入屠蘇。<br>千門萬戶曈曈日，總把新桃換舊符。
<br>
                — 《元日》王安石
<br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;關於新年的詩詞，我想總是感傷之氣息多於除舊迎新的喜悅。小的時候總覺得自己特別，別人歡呼慶祝的時候，我總是站在一邊，極是尷尬地看著別人，倒也不是厭惡什麼，就是很難高興起來——越是努力跟著高興，越是只剩下尷尬地笑。現想來這也沒什麼稀奇，梁漱溟先生就寫過說，“樂不難，樂之後不苦難”，當然這也絕不能算是他的獨創。
<br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;大多數人總是被自己短暫而易變的情緒困擾，能夠摒除掉這些噪音的人不是太天真也許就是真豪傑了。我去年下半年寫了一個本子，改來改去覺得惱人不已，今天早上本是計劃再改一稿的，卻因為對自己的失望而放棄——正所謂“奮勇之後而能繼續”比較難。這又使我想起去年春夏兩季，我每週會跟一位非常敬佩的朋友喝酒暢談，有一段時間，他這週說要去某知名大學學藝術史，下一週說是去另一某某知名大學學經濟法，再下一週又是另一番景象。能力是一回事，但信息過度的湧來之時，專注度也變得更加得支離破碎了。
<br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;上個月，在洛杉磯和 Tu Lin 吃早茶，甚是開心——她是我一開始就打定主意在洛杉磯一定要見的人。也不盡是因為她是個認真寫東西的人，也一直沒有覺得跟她過分熟悉，說話的時候我也會尷尬 (當然，我很少跟別人說話不覺得尷尬)，但就是很想拜訪，覺得這大約就是所謂神交。這詞用在我身上也許過份，畢竟總以為這是個來形容武林高手的詞。
<br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;我們共同發現我們都很久沒有拿中文寫作了。甚是可笑。但這迅速轉化成為一種岌岌可危之感，甚至可以說是一種命懸一線的緊迫感。
<br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;東八區的月曆新年第一天剛剛到了。有的人開始守歲，有的人開始寫短信，有的人在貼春聯，有的人關上電視慶祝春晚終於結束。在我的腦海中，煙花在天上炸開，大家穿著棉衣、捂著耳朵、在星火的映照下滿臉通紅，黑夜也炸成了白天。我又在想，新的一年到底應該從晚上零點開始，還是應該從千門萬戶曈曈日初始的那一刻開始呢？
<br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;其實我一點也不喜歡真的爆竹或者煙花，我只是喜歡想著它們炸開的樣子。
