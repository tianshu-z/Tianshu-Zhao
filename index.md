<p>Hello, feel free to <a href = "https://tianshu-z.github.io/biography.html"><u>get in touch</u></a> about any design projects!</p>
    
<p><strong>Feb 24, 2020</strong> | I have not been working on my composition experiments at all since I was relocated in China. However, due to the coronavirus outbreak in China, I started to write science articles under the supervision of my uncle. He's great! Hoping to play my part in the society.</p>

<p>I have weekly updates on my <a href = "https://soundcloud.com/zoe-zhao-676421317/sets/machine-or-i"><i><u>machine-and-i</u></i></a> album using machine learning algorithm to compose. I named it <i><u>machine-or-i</u></i> in the first place, but thought <i><u>machine-and-i</u></i> was more appropriate.</p>

My recent projects can be found on <a href="https://tianshu-z.github.io/work.html">here</a>.

<p><u><a href = "https://www.vicon.com/">Vicon</a> MoCap Suit Instruction: gentle wash, cold water, and air dry.</u> No need to dry clean. (There's no documentation for this. So I called the Vicon LA office.) </p>
