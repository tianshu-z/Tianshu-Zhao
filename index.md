<p>Hello, feel free to <a href = "https://tianshu-z.github.io/biography.html"><u>get in touch</u></a> about any design projects!</p>
    
<p>I have weekly updates on my <a href = "https://soundcloud.com/zoe-zhao-676421317/sets/machine-or-i"><i><u>machine-and-i</u></i></a> album using machine learning algorithm to compose. I named it <i><u>machine-or-i</u></i> in the first place, but thought <i><u>machine-and-i</u></i> was more appropriate.</p>

My recent projects can be found on <a href="https://tianshu-z.github.io/work.html">here</a>.

<p>Currently, I work for the <a href="https://ccam.yale.edu"> Center for Collaborative Arts and Media (CCAM)</a> at Yale University. The <a href = "https://www.ieee-gem.space/">2019 IEEE Games Entertainment & Media Conference</a> will be hosted here at Yale CCAM this summer from June 19th - 22nd. You will see me here.</p>
