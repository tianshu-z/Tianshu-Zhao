    <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
  <br>
    
    I have been exploring and researching utilizing algorithms to gamify and revolutionize innovative processes, thus enhancing a better understanding of the human-machine relationship. An essential question that runs through my work is how we can support projects that address meaningful social causes through better design. Using data mining and gamification, I hope to create physical and emotional interfaces and spaces for people to be engaged in a meaningful communal experience.  <br>
