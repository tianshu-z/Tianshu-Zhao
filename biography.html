    <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
  <br>
    
Tianshu is interested in visual experience design and she also directs live performances. She explores projects at the intersection of spatial design, multimedia storytelling, and AR/VR technology to create immersive audiovisual experiences. An essential question that runs through her work is how the designers can support projects that address meaningful social causes, and how they can create physical and emotional space for human interaction.
