    <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
  <br>
    
Tianshu is a visual experience designer and a director of live performances. She explores projects at the intersection of spatial design, multimedia storytelling, and AR/VR technology to create fully immersive audiovisual experiences. An essential question that runs through her work is how the designers can support projects that address meaningful social causes, and how they can create physical and emotional space for human interaction.
    <br>
    <br>
Tianshu has worked internationally on theatre projects, installations, VR/AR development, data visualization, and graphic designs in New York City, New Haven, Chicago, Urbana-Champaign, and Beijing. Her recent projects can be found on <a href="https://tianshu-z.github.io/work.html">the WORK page on her website</a>.
