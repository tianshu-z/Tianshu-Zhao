    <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
  <br>
    
I am a visual content creator and theatre director.  Iâ€™m passionate about time-based multimedia design for live performances and human digital interactions. My interest lies in infusing projects with immersive experiences that work across the senses, by interweaving efforts of both scholarship and praxis. Using technology in lighting and projection design, I seek to extend the performance space beyond the theatre house and to incorporate both heightened and lessened sensorial experiences, especially when it comes to storytelling that may not be best served by traditional theatrical presentation.
